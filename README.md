This repository having name Hacktoberfest2020 is created for helping beginners to learn about open source projects and motivate them
for contributing in such projects. There are many experts out there but more people are just beginners and right now trying to create a new GitHub repository 
with name "Practice" or "Hello-World" for practice purpose.
This repo is created to help all such people by making them aware of open source and the way they can work in a team by making small contributions. We have included very basic programs here which are helpful for graduate students in there course work or placements of some of the companies. To make it more exhaustive list, we will keep adding new programs in the list which is surely going to be very helpful for all such beginners.



You are invited to make changes in this repository, we will accept your pull request if you fulfil all the basic criterias of program writing as listed below - 

1. Please take care of the file name, function name and variables for higher chances of getting your request accepted.
2. FileName should be in following format - Qn_main_function.extension, where Qn denotes the question no, main_function is main functionality of the program and finally extensuon which is dependent on programming language you are going to follow for that particular program.
Example - For the first program in the list I will make file name - Q1_factorial_sum.c or Q1_factorial_sum.cpp or Q1_factorial_sum.py etc.
3. Indent the code properly with necessary comments in the file.
